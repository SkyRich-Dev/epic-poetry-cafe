# Epic Poetry Cafe - Operations Management System

## Overview

The Epic Poetry Cafe Operations Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and manage all critical aspects of cafe operations. Its primary purpose is to enhance efficiency, reduce waste, and improve profitability by providing modules for vendor management, ingredient tracking, recipe costing, purchasing, expense management, inventory control, sales, waste management, R&D/trials, and robust financial analytics. The system aims to provide real-time insights into the cafe's performance, support informed decision-making, and automate tedious manual processes, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and profitable business.

## User Preferences

I want you to act as a senior software engineer. I prefer detailed explanations and a collaborative approach. Before making any major changes or implementing new features, please discuss the approach and design choices with me. I appreciate clean, maintainable code with good test coverage. Do not make changes to files within the `lib/api-spec/` and `lib/api-client-react/` directories unless specifically instructed, as these are generated.

## System Architecture

The system is built as a monorepo utilizing `pnpm workspaces` for managing various components. It uses Node.js 24 and TypeScript 5.9.

**Frontend:**
- Developed with React and Vite, located in `artifacts/epic-poetry-cafe`.
- Provides a comprehensive UI with pages for login, dashboard, various operational modules, reports, and administrative masters.
- Implements an `AuthContext` for JWT token management in `localStorage`.
- Features a role-based dashboard: "Owner's Dashboard" for admins with full P&L, settlements, vendor payables, and detailed trend charts (recharts); "Operations Dashboard" for managers/viewers focusing on daily operational metrics.
- UI/UX uses a modern Material-You-inspired design with Inter font family, cool-navy sidebar palette, 260px slim sidebar, rounded-2xl containers, pill-style tab selectors (`bg-muted/60 rounded-xl`), softer focus rings, and consistent `hover:bg-muted/30` table row hover effects. Login page features a split layout with cafe image and clean form.
- Access control is implemented at the route level, displaying "Access Restricted" for non-authorized users.
- Date input fields enforce `max={today}` to prevent future date entries.

**Backend:**
- An Express 5 API server, located in `artifacts/api-server`.
- Uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence, defining over 22 tables.
- Implements a custom JWT authentication scheme (HMAC-SHA256) with `SESSION_SECRET` and role-based access control (`admin`, `manager`, `viewer`). Password hashing uses PBKDF2 with random salt (legacy SHA256 fallback for migration).
- All API routes are prefixed with `/api`. Global auth middleware protects most routes, with exceptions for `/api/healthz` and `/api/auth/login`.
- `Orval` is used for API client code generation from an OpenAPI specification, generating React Query hooks (`lib/api-client-react/`) and Zod schemas (`lib/api-zod/`).
- Validation is handled using `Zod`.
- Uses `esbuild` for CJS bundle builds.
- Critical operations in modules like sales, purchases, and expenses have an Admin Verification system (`verified`, `verifiedBy`, `verifiedAt` columns) with specific API endpoints for verification and unverification.
- Implements a robust `Costing Engine` that supports weighted average (default), latest, or standard cost methods, accounting for UOM conversions.
- Features auto-generation of unique codes for various entities (e.g., VND0001, ING0001).
- Database transactions are used for atomicity in critical import processes (e.g., sales invoices, Petpooja data).
- `PATCH` operations automatically use `.partial()` schemas for flexible updates.
- Centralized date validation helper (`validateNotFutureDate`) on the backend.
- Uploaded payment proofs for salary are served via authenticated routes.

**Key Features:**
- **Inventory Management**: Purchases auto-update stock and weighted average costs; waste auto-deducts from stock. Purchase/waste deletion properly reverses stock changes. Negative stock is prevented on inventory adjustments. Deletion of vendors, ingredients, categories, and menu items is guarded against referential usage.
- **Vendor Bills**: The vendor detail "Bills" tab supports per-bill detail view (modal with vendor info, line items and totals breakdown) and PDF download. PDF endpoint: `GET /api/purchases/:id/pdf` (auth required) generates an A4 portrait bill matching the existing report PDF styling (purple #6750A4 header). The "Record New Purchase" dialog header shows a live count of line items, e.g. "Items Received (3)".
- **PDFKit fonts in production build**: `artifacts/api-server/build.mjs` copies `node_modules/pdfkit/data/*.afm` to `dist/data/` after esbuild bundling so PDFKit's standard fonts (Helvetica, etc.) resolve at runtime. Without this, every PDF endpoint returns a 500 with `ENOENT: ... dist/data/Helvetica.afm`.
- **Trial Management (R&D)**: Full version-based R&D tracking with ingredient usage per version, automatic inventory deduction (stock reduced on version creation), expense calculation from weighted avg cost, prep time tracking per version, quality scoring (taste/appearance/consistency), and conversion of approved versions to menu items with recipes. Cascade delete ensures clean removal of trials with all versions and ingredient lines. Schema: `trials` → `trial_versions` (with `trialDate`, `prepTime`, `inventoryDeducted`) → `trial_ingredient_lines`.
- **Daily Sales Settlement**: Reconciliation of daily sales against payment collections with admin verification.
- **Petty Cash Management**: Comprehensive ledger with running balance, negative balance protection, and auto-linking with expenses.
- **Daily P&L**: Real-time calculation of profit and loss.
- **Consumption Variance**: Comparison of actual vs. theoretical ingredient usage.
- **Bulk Data Import**: Excel upload for sales invoices, purchases, expenses, menu items with recipes, and Petpooja import — all with row-by-row validation, name-matching, and downloadable templates. Petpooja import auto-creates categories and menu items with price when items don't exist.
- **POS Integration**: Real-time Petpooja POS integration via webhook (`POST /api/webhook/petpooja/:integrationId`). Handles the official Petpooja Global API `orderdetails` event payload format — supports basic orders, discounts (order-level & item-level), add-ons, part payments (Cash+Card mixed), online aggregator orders (Zomato/Swiggy), tax allocation (CGST/SGST), and service/packaging/delivery charges. Auto-creates categories and menu items from POS data when they don't exist (codes prefixed `PP`). Token-based webhook authentication via the `token` field in payload body. Also supports general POS integrations (POSist, UrbanPiper, custom) with secure webhook handling. The manual Petpooja Item Mapping module has been removed — all item resolution is automatic by name matching + auto-creation.
- **Employee Management**: CRUD operations for employees, shifts, attendance tracking (present, half-day, absent, week-off), and leave management.
- **Salary Generation**: Admin-only feature calculating net salary based on attendance and leaves, with payment status tracking and proof upload.
- **Vendor Finance Tracking**: Bill-wise payment recording, ledger tracking (debit/credit/running balance), aging analysis, and payment proof uploads.
- **Sales Invoice Module**: All sales flow through invoices (Petpooja POS or manual entry). Features line items, GST calculation, proportional discount allocation, match verification, and item/daily/consumption analytics. Quick Sales have been fully removed — all backend calculations (dashboard, P&L, reports, settlements, consumption variance) source from `sales_invoices` + `sales_invoice_lines`.
