- **Upload**: POST /upload/sales, /upload/purchases, /upload/expenses, /upload/menu (multipart file), GET /upload/template/:type (xlsx template download, type=sales|purchases|expenses|menu)
- **Reports (Analytics)**: GET /reports/item-profitability, /reports/item-wastage (params: period=daily|weekly|monthly|custom, fromDate, toDate)
- **Dashboard**: GET /dashboard/summary, /profitability, /daily-pl, /consumption-variance, /sales-trend, /expense-breakdown, /vendor-spend, /trend (authenticated)
- **Reports**: GET /reports/export?reportType=...
- **Audit Logs**: GET /audit-logs

## Auth

- Custom JWT auth: POST /auth/login, GET /auth/me, POST /auth/change-password
- Roles: `admin` (full access), `manager` (daily operations only), `viewer` (read-only)
- Admin-only routes: config PATCH, users CRUD, audit-logs, upload, reports, trials
- **User Management page**: Admin can create users, assign roles (Admin/Manager/Viewer), edit profiles, change passwords, activate/deactivate accounts
- Manager can access: dashboard, sales, purchases, expenses, waste, menu, ingredients, inventory, vendors
- Default users: admin / admin123 (admin role), manager / manager123 (manager role)
- JWT stored in localStorage, sent as Authorization: Bearer header

## Verification System

- **Admin verification** on 6 modules: Ingredients, Menu Items, Sales, Purchases, Expenses, Waste
- DB columns: `verified` (boolean, default false), `verifiedBy` (int, nullable), `verifiedAt` (timestamp, nullable)
- API endpoints: `PATCH /:id/verify` and `PATCH /:id/unverify` (admin-only via `adminOnly` middleware)
- Edit/delete guards: If `verified=true` AND `userRole !== "admin"` → 403 on PATCH/DELETE (including recipe updates for menu items)
- Admin can always edit/delete regardless of verification status
- Frontend: `VerifyButton` component in ui-extras.tsx; each table shows Verified column with toggle buttons for admin, read-only badges for non-admin
- `apiVerify(module, id)` and `apiUnverify(module, id)` helper functions use `customFetch` directly (not generated hooks)

## Key Features

- **Costing Engine**: Weighted average (default), latest, or standard cost methods. Uses UOM conversion factor (stock-to-recipe) for accurate recipe line costing.
- **Auto code generation**: VND0001, ING0001, MNU0001, PUR0001, EXP0001, WST0001, TRL0001
- **Purchase -> Inventory**: Purchases auto-update ingredient stock + weighted avg cost
- **Waste -> Stock**: Ingredient waste auto-deducts from stock
- **Trial -> Menu**: Convert approved trial versions to menu item recipes
- **Daily Sales Settlement**: Reconcile daily sales against payment collections (Cash, Card, QR, UPI, etc.); one settlement per date; auto-calculates difference (matched/short/excess); admin-only verification workflow
- **Petty Cash Ledger**: Full petty cash management (receipts, expenses, adjustments); running balance tracking; negative balance protection; auto-linked when expenses use "Petty Cash" payment mode
- **Expense-Petty Cash Link**: Creating expense with "Petty Cash" payment mode auto-creates petty cash ledger entry; deleting expense auto-removes linked petty cash entry; linked entries cannot be deleted directly from petty cash
- **Daily P&L**: Real-time profit/loss calculation from sales, material cost, waste, expenses
- **Consumption Variance**: Compare actual vs theoretical ingredient consumption (converted to stock UOM)
- **Excel Upload**: Bulk import sales, purchases, expenses from .xlsx/.xls files with row-by-row validation, auto name-matching (vendors, ingredients, menu items), and detailed import results
- **Auth Token**: Frontend uses setAuthTokenGetter from custom-fetch for global API auth header injection
- **PATCH operations**: All update schemas use .partial() for optional field updates
- **Role-based Dashboard**: Admin sees "Owner's Dashboard" with full P&L, settlements, insights, top items, and recharts-powered trend charts (Sales vs Expenses bar chart + Profit Trend line chart with 7D/14D/30D period selector). Manager/viewer sees "Operations Dashboard" with only: sales (with comparison badges), expenses, waste, petty cash balance, petty cash spent
- **Password Change**: All users can change password from sidebar (key icon). Modal validates current password, min 6 chars, confirmation match
- **Attendance Monthly Summary**: Monthly summary tab showing per-employee present/half-day/absent/week-off counts and attendance percentage
- **Dashboard Date Filters**: Filter bar with Today/Date/Date Range/This Week/This Month modes. Week and month modes have prev/next navigation arrows. Labels dynamically adjust (e.g., "Today's Sales" → "Weekly Sales" → "Monthly Sales"). Backend accepts fromDate/toDate query params, falling back to single date for backward compat. Range mode compares vs previous equivalent period
- **Menu Cost Visibility**: Production cost and margin columns on Menu Items page are hidden from non-admin users
- **Route-level Access Control**: Admin-only pages (Trials, Analytics, Reports, Masters, Upload) show "Access Restricted" page for non-admin users, even if accessed via direct URL
- **Employee Module**: Full employee management with auto-generated codes (EMP0001...), contact, position, salary, part-time/full-time. Admin-only CRUD; non-admin sees only name, code, position, type (no salary/contact)
- **Shifts**: Define shifts with name, start/end time. Used in attendance marking
- **Attendance**: Daily attendance with bulk save — statuses: present, half-day, absent, week-off. All users can mark attendance
- **Leave Management**: Record paid/unpaid leaves per employee per date. Week-off = paid leave (no deduction). All users can record leaves
- **Salary Generation**: Admin-only. Auto-computes net salary from base salary, attendance, leaves. Deductions for unpaid leaves, absences, and half-days (0.5× per-day rate). DB-level date filtering with LIKE on YYYY-MM prefix
- **Salary Payment Status**: Each salary record has `paymentStatus` (pending/paid), `paymentProofUrl`, `paidAt`, `paidBy`. Admin can toggle paid/pending status and upload payment proof (image/PDF, max 5MB). Proof files served via authenticated route (not public)
- **Sales Fixed Pricing**: Sales entries always use the menu item's fixed `sellingPrice` — the price field is read-only in the UI and enforced server-side. Explicit `discount` field shown in form and table. Total = qty × menuPrice − discount
- **Salary Proof Upload**: POST /salary/:id/upload-proof (multipart, admin-only), GET /uploads/salary-proofs/:filename (authenticated)
